## Development

To manage all the Docker containers inside the Kubernetes cluster and simplify development workflow the project uses Skaffold.

To run the app in development environment, make sure Docker, Kubernetes and Skaffold are installed on your local machine.

Before running the app environment variables inside the Kubernetes cluster must be set. Execute commands below to set these environment variables:

```bash
# kubectl create secret generic paypal-secret --from-literal=PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=<your_paypal_key>

# kubectl create secret generic paypal-secret2 --from-literal=PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_paypal_secret_key>

# kubectl create secret generic jwt-secret --from-literal=JWT_KEY=<your_jwt_key>

```

Be sure to expose the ingress-nginx-controller with:

```bash
# kubectl expose deployment ingress-nginx-contoller --target-port=80 --type=NodePort -n kube-system
```

Start the app with `skaffold dev`.

### Set up mock host name (local dev)

  - To redirect requests coming to: ticketing.dev => localhost      
  - only for local development purposes

  - MacOS/Linux:  
  modify `/etc/hosts` file to include `127.0.0.1 ticketing.dev`

  - Windows:  
  modify `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` file to include `127.0.0.1 ticketing.dev`

  - To skip the unskippable HTTPS warning in Chrome:    
  try type **thisisunsafe**

  - **__mocks__**: Mock files for testing purposes.
    - `nats-wrapper.ts`: Mock implementation for NATS Streaming Server wrapper.
  - **events**: Contains event-related logic.
    - **listeners**: Event listeners for different events.
      - `order-created-listener.ts`: Listener for the order created event.
      - `queue-group-name.ts`: Defines the queue group name for event listeners.
    - **publishers**: Event publishers for different events.
      - `expiration-completed-publisher.ts`: Publisher for the expiration completed event.
  - **queues**: Manages background job processing.
    - `expiration-queue.ts`: Handles tasks related to order expiration using Bull.
  - `index.ts`: Main file to start the Expiration Service.
  - `nats-wrapper.ts`: Wrapper for connecting to NATS Streaming Server.

- **.dockerignore**: Specifies files and directories to be excluded from Docker builds.

- **Dockerfile**: Defines instructions for building a Docker image for the Expiration Service.

- **package-lock.json**: Auto-generated file for package version tracking.

- **package.json**: Configuration file that includes project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.

- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration file.

#### Event Listeners

#### 1. Order Created Listener

- **File**: `order-created-listener.ts`
- **Description**: Listens for the order created event.

#### 2. Queue Group Name

- **File**: `queue-group-name.ts`
- **Description**: Defines the queue group name for event listeners.
- 
#### Event Publishers

#### 1. Expiration Completed Publisher

- **File**: `expiration-completed-publisher.ts`
- **Description**: Publishes an event when the order expiration process is completed.

#### Queues

#### 1. Expiration Queue

- **File**: `expiration-queue.ts`
- **Description**: Manages background job processing related to order expiration using Bull.

    - **Initialization**:
        1. The queue is created using the `Queue` class from Bull.
        2. It is named `'order:expiration'` to identify and process expiration-related tasks.
        3. Configuration includes connecting to a `Redis` instance specified by `REDIS_HOST` environment variable.

    - **Task Processing**:
        1. The queue is set to process tasks asynchronously.
        2. Tasks are added to the queue when an order is created.
        3. The processing logic handles the completion of the order expiration process and triggers the `Expiration Completed Publisher` to notify other microservices.

### Important Notes

- The Expiration Service plays a crucial role in managing the expiration of orders within the application.

- Event listeners and publishers contribute to the event-driven architecture, ensuring seamless communication between microservices.

- The expiration queue efficiently handles background tasks asynchronously, improving overall system responsiveness.

- Redis is utilized as the storage backend for Bull queues, providing durability and reliability for managing tasks.

- Ensure that the `REDIS_HOST` environment variable is correctly configured to connect to the Redis instance.

The Expiration Service enhances the application's architecture by handling order expiration through event-driven processing and efficient background task management.
